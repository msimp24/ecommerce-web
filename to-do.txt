To Do:

- On clicked book, bring user to a book description page. This will give the user to option to learn more on the book and decide if they want to add the
book to their cart.

- Create drop down for cart when clicked on. This will display the user's current shopping cart and allow them to edit anything in the cart if they wanted 
to change any of their options.

- Create drop down for nav bar when webpage is shrunk in size.

- Create form for user to enter personal data as well as shipping/billing data.

- MAYBE create payment with node js (not sure if I can do this as a single page web application but will see)
